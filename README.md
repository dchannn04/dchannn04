-Hi, I'm Derick Chan. I am a recent computer science graduate from Villanova University. 
-I am currently a support developer, but I have recently developed a passion for web3 and blockchain technology. 

-My technical skills from my education consist of Java, JS, HTML, Python, CSS, React, and SQL. 
-I am currently learning web3.js and Solidity, and have been for the past year or so. 

-I would love to be able to work in the web3 space and be able to build out full stack applications on the blockchain. 
-You can reach me at chanderick44@gmail.com or visit my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/derick-chan44/!

-When I'm not coding I enjoy hiking, playing basketball, taking pictures, and listening to music!
